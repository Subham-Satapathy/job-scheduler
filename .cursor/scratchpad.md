# Job Scheduler - Development Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
User requested the creation of an `env.example` file containing all required environment variables for the Job Scheduler application.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- **Create env.example file** (COMPLETED)
  - Analyzed `src/config/env.config.ts` to identify all required environment variables
  - Created comprehensive `env.example` file with:
    - Server configuration (PORT, NODE_ENV)
    - Database configuration (DATABASE_URL, connection pooling settings)
    - Redis configuration (host, port, password, URL, optimization settings)
    - BullMQ configuration (prefix)
    - Rate limiting configuration
    - Logging configuration
  - Included detailed comments and example values for each variable
  - Marked required vs optional variables appropriately

## Project Status Board
- [x] **env.example creation** - Successfully created with all 20 environment variables from config

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
**Task Completed Successfully**: The `env.example` file has been created with all required environment variables found in the application configuration. The file includes:

- Clear section organization with headers
- Detailed comments explaining each variable's purpose
- Default values where applicable
- Format examples for complex variables (URLs)
- Distinction between required and optional variables

The file is ready for developers to copy to `.env` and customize with their actual values.

## Lessons
- Successfully identified all environment variables by analyzing the EnvironmentConfig interface and EnvironmentValidator class
- Used the default values and descriptions from the validation logic to provide helpful examples
